# TO THE MOOOOOOON

I like investing and learning about the stock market.

This is an investment calculator that I tried to reverse engineer.

Really enjoyed this project and found that calculating compounding interest was harder than expected.

This is also an Electron app. So, if you are so inclined you can build this into a desktop app
if you are using a Linux machine. In order to do so, clone this repo and then run the following command:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn preelectron-pack`
- `yarn electron-pack`

Check out the live version here:
